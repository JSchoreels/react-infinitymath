        <h1> End of the year - Notebook </h1>
        <p> Hello everyone,</p>

        <p> To end the school year with my students, I use this little folder of logic puzzles.</p>
        <p>This allows them to think while having fun.</p>
        <p>In general, students are divided into teams and the group with the most correct answers wins the game.</p>
        <p>The file contains 15 puzzles with the correction and is FREE.</p>
        <p>Correction are available.</p>
        <p>The file is FREE.</p>
